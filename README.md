# About
This is a project for Data Science Pro Bootcamp.

I took song lyrics from 2 sources: 

  * https://github.com/wdw21/songbook

     453 xml files with songs mainly in Polish, all these files come from the 21WDW (scouts group) songbook written over the years by various guitarists.

  * https://github.com/qamil95/spiewnik

     1006 latex files with songs mainly in Polish come from Cracow's songbook of "around the mountains" songs

I extracted interesting data from .xml and .tex files.
I worked on the text, cleaned it, removed stopwords, did stemming, etc. 
I presented statistics. I removed duplicates. 
I combined them into clusters.
